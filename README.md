# Social Media Analytics

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze social media trends to provide insights into brand perception, market trends, and customer engagement. By leveraging techniques in text mining, sentiment analysis, network analysis, and data visualization, this project aims to deliver actionable insights that can help brands understand their online presence and improve their marketing strategies.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess data from various social media platforms to ensure it is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.
- **Techniques Used:** Web scraping, API usage, data cleaning, normalization, handling missing values, text preprocessing.

### 2. Text Mining
Extract meaningful information from text data using various text mining techniques.

- **Techniques Used:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization, TF-IDF, word embeddings.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
Analyze the sentiment of social media posts to understand public opinion and brand perception.

- **Techniques Used:** Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral), emotion detection, use of pre-trained sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, BERT).

### 4. Network Analysis
Analyze the relationships and interactions between users on social media to understand the structure and dynamics of the network.

- **Techniques Used:** Graph theory, centrality measures, community detection, visualization of social networks.

### 5. Data Visualization
Visualize the results of the analysis to provide clear and actionable insights.

- **Techniques Used:** Word clouds, sentiment trend graphs, network graphs, dashboards using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Power BI.
